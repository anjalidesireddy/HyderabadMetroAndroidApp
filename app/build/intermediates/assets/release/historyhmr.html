        To respond to the rising public transport needs and mitigate escalating vehicular traffic in the twin-cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh Government and the South Central Railway zone jointly launched the Multi Modal Transport System (MMTS) in August 2003.This Rs. 167 crores worth transport system, 50 percent of which was financed by the State Government and the remaining by the Central Government, used the already existing rail lines of the Indian Railways in and around Hyderabad making it a highly cost effective one. However, within months of starting of its operation, it became apparent that it has been met with poor response.The reasons for this dismal response include poor punctuality of trains, lack of dedicated tracks for MMTS services, and absence of feeder bus services limiting the network's reach.
        Though the ridership of the MMTS has increased over the years, the failure in augmentation of the services in line with the increasing ridership has led to its unpopularity among 150,000 passengers who avail the services daily. This notwithstanding, the Union Ministry of Urban Development, in October 2003, gave its nod for the Hyderabad Metro Rail Project and directed the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to conduct a survey on the project.Involving an investment of over Rs.4000 crores, this project was seen necessary in view that the population of Hyderabad was forecasted to reach 13.6 million by the year 2021.According to the initial plan, the metro was to be connected with the already existing MMTS to provide commuters with alternate modes of transport. Simultaneously, the proposals for taking up the construction of MMTS Phase-II were also taken forward.Like Delhi, Hyderabad's metro project is ambitious in scope and swift in execution. Following a construction period of just five years, the first phase, comprising three lines totalling 71 km with 66 stations will be completed in November 2018.It is also a technical pioneer, bringing CBTC to an Indian city for the first time.</h6>

        The first highly sophisticated train of the Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) came from Korea during the third week of May 2014. Stringent trial runs commenced from June 2014 till February 2015.The trial runs started on the Miyapur to Sanjeeva Reddy Nagar stretch in October 2015.

        CMRS inspection for Stage-II (Miyapur and S.R.Nagar Section) was done on 9, 10 August 2016.Three interchanges are planned at Mahatma Gandhi Bus Terminus, Parade Grounds and Ameerpet.

        The steel bridge of the HMR was successfully placed over the Oliphant bridge in August 2017.

        In November 2017, Commissioner of Railway Safety (CMRS) granted safety approval for 12 km stretch from Miyapur to SR Nagar, 10 km stretch from SR Nagar to Mettuguda and 8 km stretch from Nagole to Mettuguda.</h6>
